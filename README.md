Speed Detector
This program calculates demerit points for speeding based on the given criteria.


Speed Limit: 70 km/h
For every 5 km/h over the speed limit, the driver gets one demerit point.
If the driver accumulates 12 or more points, their license is suspended.
Example
Input: Enter the speed of the car in km/h when prompted.
Output: The program will determine and display the demerit points or "License suspended" message.
Example Run:

If you input 80, the program will output Points: 2.
If you input 65, the program will output Ok.
If you input 140, the program will output License suspended.
Edge Cases
Entering 70 will result in Ok.
Entering speeds resulting in different demerit points scenarios are also handled.
